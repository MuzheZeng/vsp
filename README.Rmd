## Installation

`vsp` is experimental and nascent. If you are a collaborator on the project, you can install the development version with:

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("alexpghayes/vsp", auth_token = NEED_TO_DO_THIS)
```

You'll need to set up a Github auth token. See the documentation in `?remotes::install_github()` for details on how to do this.

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r}
library(vsp)
library(Matrix)

M <- rsparsematrix(12, 12, nnz = 40)  # this breaks things
M2 <- sign(M)^2                       # but this doesn't
vsp(M2, k = 7)
```
